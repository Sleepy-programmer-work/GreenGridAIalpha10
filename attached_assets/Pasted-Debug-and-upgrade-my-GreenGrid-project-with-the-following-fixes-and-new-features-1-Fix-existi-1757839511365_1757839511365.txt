Debug and upgrade my GreenGrid project with the following fixes and new features:

1. **Fix existing errors**
   - Fix the `/api/readings` and `/api/battery` routes → they must accept `POST` requests for adding new logs.
   - Ensure the "Add Schedule" button in the Battery tab works properly (route + DB schema fix).
   - Resolve error 500 when adding battery logs.

2. **Add Dummy Data API (for simulation)**
   - Create `/api/mock/appliance` → returns random appliance readings (name, power, timestamp).
   - Create `/api/mock/battery` → simulates battery charge/discharge logs (State of Charge %, DoD, timestamp).
   - Create `/api/mock/grid` → generates dummy grid tariff data (timestamp, tariff_rate ₹/kWh, max_load).
   - Auto-ingest this dummy data every few seconds into the database so that the dashboard always has fresh values.

3. **Frontend Auto Simulation**
   - Add a "Start Simulation" toggle button in each tab (Appliances, Battery, Analytics).
   - When ON → fetch dummy API data every 5 seconds and save it via the respective backend routes.
   - When OFF → stop fetching.

4. **Anomaly Detection**
   - On appliance readings, flag:
     - Power > 1500W → Warning
     - Power > 1800W → Critical
   - Store anomalies in DB and show them in the "Recent Anomaly Detections" list.
   - Color-coded alerts: green (normal), yellow (warning), red (critical).

5. **Graph & UI Fixes**
   - Fix all charts (Dashboard, Forecasting, Analytics, Battery) → use multiple distinct colors instead of black/white.
   - Forecasting tab → show both solar generation forecast + weather details correctly.
   - Analytics tab → show trend charts, pie charts, and KPIs using dummy data.
   - Style graphs with Tailwind + Recharts (distinct bright colors: blue, green, orange, red).

6. **Grid Tariff Integration**
   - In Analytics, add a "Grid Tariff Trends" chart that shows hourly/daily tariff_rate from the mock API.
   - Add KPI cards: "Current Tariff", "Peak Tariff", "Avg Tariff".
   - Allow anomaly alerts if household load > max_load (critical).

7. **UI Enhancements**
   - Apply Apple-inspired design:
     - Glassmorphism cards with blur + neon glow.
     - Bold headlines, animated KPI numbers.
     - Smooth animations with Framer Motion.
     - Responsive layout for all pages.

Deliverable:
- Working full-stack app with auto-generated dummy data (appliance readings, grid tariff, battery logs).
- All errors fixed.
- Live updating graphs + anomaly detection + premium Apple-style UI.
