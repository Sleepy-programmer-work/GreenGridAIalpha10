🌱 Project Idea (MVP)

Title: GreenGrid – AI-Powered Renewable Energy Management Platform

📝 Problem

Renewable energy is intermittent (solar and wind fluctuate with weather).

Communities and individuals waste renewable resources due to poor scheduling and lack of awareness.

No easy software tool exists to predict, plan, and optimize renewable usage at household/community scale.

🎯 Proposed Solution

A software-only platform (web + mobile app) that uses AI, data analytics, and cloud dashboards to:

Forecast Renewable Energy Availability

Predict solar/wind output using weather APIs + historical usage.

Suggest “best times” to use or store energy.

Optimize Energy Consumption

AI recommends appliance schedules (washing machine, water pump, etc.) to align with renewable availability.

Reduce dependence on non-renewable grid power.

Track & Visualize Sustainability

Dashboards showing:
✅ Renewable energy used vs. wasted
✅ Cost savings
✅ Carbon emissions avoided

Community-Level Insights

Allow societies, campuses, or industries to view collective savings.

Compare with nearby communities (gamification + leaderboard).

⚙️ MVP Features
Phase 1 (Basic MVP – 2 months)

User Account + Energy Logging: Manual entry or upload electricity bills.

Dashboard: Graphs showing daily/weekly renewable usage, wastage, cost savings.

AI Module: Basic prediction using weather API + consumption history.

Suggestions: Notifications like “Run pump at 3 PM, high solar output expected.”

Phase 2 (Extended MVP – 4 months)

Community Dashboard: Compare energy usage across groups.

Gamification: Badges & points for sustainable practices.

Carbon Tracker: Show environmental impact (trees saved, CO₂ reduced).

API Integration: Option to connect with smart meters / solar inverters later (not mandatory for MVP).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend (Web + Mobile): React.js + React Native / Flutter

Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js

Database: PostgreSQL / Firebase

AI/ML: Scikit-learn / TensorFlow Lite for prediction

APIs: OpenWeather API for weather data, Electricity bill parsing API (optional)

Hosting: AWS / Azure / GCP

🚀 Expected Impact

Households: Reduce electricity bills by 10–20%.

Communities: Better planning for solar/wind installations.

Environment: Lower carbon footprint through efficient renewable adoption.

Scalability: Can scale from individuals → housing societies → smart cities.

✅ This MVP is 100% software-based, hackathon-feasible, and scalable.
✅ Judges will like that it has AI, sustainability, dashboards, and community impact.
